## Description:
Food Finder is a comprehensive recipe search application. Utilizing the Spoonacular API, the application allows users to input a keyword, based on which it retrieves a list of recipes. Users can peruse this list, and each recipe's details including ingredients and step-by-step instructions can be viewed with a simple click on the recipe's image. Users also have the functionality to save their favorite recipes for quick access later. These saved recipes persist even when the application is closed, thanks to the use of local storage.

## Usage:
To use Food Finder, you can clone the repository from GitHub and open the `index.html` file in your web browser. Once the application is open, type your desired recipe or ingredient into the search bar located at the top of the page and either press Enter or click the 'Search' button. A list of recipes will populate below the search bar. To learn more about a recipe, click on its image. A modal will appear with the recipe's image, ingredients, and instructions. To save a recipe for later, click on the 'Save' button. Your saved recipes can be viewed by clicking on the 'My Recipes' button located in the navbar. This will clear the currently displayed recipes and display your saved recipes instead. [Live Link](https://thinker92.github.io/FoodFinder/)
